## About this Project

This repository hosts an **interactive exploratory data analysis (EDA) gallery** built entirely with **Altair** on the landmark MERFISH dataset from:

> **Moffitt & Bambah-Mukku et al., “Molecular, spatial, and functional single-cell profiling of the hypothalamic preoptic region”**,  
> *Science* 362, eaau5324 (2018) → [Read the paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aau5324)  
> → [Download the data (Dryad)](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.8t8s248)

We display **eight fully interactive Altair dashboards** (two per team member) to explore:
- Fine-grained anatomical mapping of cells (MERFISH data) onto a mouse brain atlas.
- Sex-biased neuronal activation and spatial sexual dimorphism.
- Individual vs. sex-driven gene expression variance.
- Cell class distributions and inhibitory marker co-expression.

All visualizations are **self-contained static HTML files**, hosted directly via our [GitHub Pages](https://yvinc.github.io/dsci-320-seq-and-see-pages/).
